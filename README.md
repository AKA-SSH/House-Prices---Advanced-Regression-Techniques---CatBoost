## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project that addresses the Kaggle competition ["House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) using CatBoost, a powerful gradient boosting library. The goal of this project is to predict house sale prices based on various features and attributes.

### Key Features

- Utilizes the CatBoost machine learning library for regression.
- Implements feature engineering, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Provides a Jupyter Notebook (`House_Prices_Advanced_Regression.ipynb`) that explains the project step-by-step.
- Achieves competitive results in the Kaggle competition.
